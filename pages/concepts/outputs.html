<bp-h1>Outputs</bp-h1>

<p>
    Blueprint Outputs are values that a Stack exposes after resources are
    created or updated. They extract specific information from your
    infrastructure and make it available for use elsewhere. Outputs typically
    include things like unique identifiers, resource IDs, or any other
    dynamically generated values that you need to reference later.
</p>

<!-- TODO: usage example here -->

<p>Outputs are crucial for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Communicate between Stacks. Outputs enable different stacks to
        communicate with each other. One stack can output a connection string
        that another stack can consume, creating loose coupling between
        infrastructure components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dynamic value access. Many infrastructure values aren't known until
        resources are created. Outputs capture these dynamic values and make
        them accessible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration points. Outputs provide clean interfaces between your
        infrastructure and applications. Your application deployment pipeline
        can query outputs to get the Studio URL or GraphQL endpoint it needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modular architecture. When using modules or reusable infrastructure
        components, outputs define the contract of what information the module
        provides. This makes modules more reusable and predictable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Automation workflows: CI/CD pipelines and automation scripts can use
        outputs to chain together infrastructure operations. For example, after
        creating an HTTP Function, you might output the endpoint for subsequent
        deployment steps.
    </li>
    <li>
        Documentation and visibility: Outputs serve as a form of documentation,
        clearly showing what important values your infrastructure produces and
        making them easily discoverable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Configuration Management: applications often need infrastructure details
        for their configuration. Rather than hardcoding values or manually
        copying them, outputs provide an automated way to inject infrastructure
        details into application configs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Debugging and operations: Outputs make it easy to quickly access key
        infrastructure information during troubleshooting or operational tasks
        without having to dig through the cloud console.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This creates a clean separation between infrastructure provisioning and
    consumption, making your overall system more maintainable and automated.
