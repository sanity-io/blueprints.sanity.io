<bp-h1>What are Blueprints?</bp-h1>
<p>Blueprints are the method of managing and provisioning Sanity resources using machine-readable definition files, rather than manual configuration with error prone interactive tools like command line interfaces or web consoles. Blueprints treat your infrastructure like software, describing it in code, and using that code to automate the deployment and management of resources deterministically.
</p>

<bp-h2>Why are Blueprints important?</bp-h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Blueprints reliably automate the process of setting up and configuring infrastructure.
  <li>Blueprints allow customers to store their infrastructure definitions in version control systems, similar to how they already manage application code, enabling easy tracking of changes and rollbacks.
  <li>Blueprints ensure that infrastructure is consistently configured and deployed, making it easier to reproduce environments, fix bugs faster, and avoid manual configuration errors.
  <li>Blueprints facilitate better collaboration between the various roles of Sanity users,from editors, to developers, to security teams, to senior management. Everyone can work with the same infrastructure definition, reducing the time and effort required to provision and maintain resources in their Sanity implementation.
</ul>
