<bp-h1>Stacks</bp-h1>
<p>
In infrastructure-as-code, a stack is a collection of resources that are managed together as a single unit. Think of it as a logical grouping or container that holds related infrastructure components and manages their lifecycle collectively.
</p>
<p>
A stack typically represents a complete environment or a logically related set of infrastructure. For example, you might have a stack that includes:
<ul>
  <li>Studio for Content Editors</li>
  <li>Dataset</li>
  <li>Webhook</li>
</ul>
All working together to support a particular use case.

<bp-h2>Benefits of Stacks</bp-h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Lifecycle Management: You can create, update, or destroy an entire stack as one atomic operation. This means you can spin up a complete environment with a single command, or tear it down just as easily.
  <li>Isolation: Stacks provide boundaries between different environments or applications. Your development stack is completely separate from your production stack, preventing accidental changes from affecting the wrong environment.
  <li>Dependency Tracking: Blueprints understands the relationships between resources within a stack and can manage dependencies automatically. It knows to create the Project before the Dataset, for instance.
  <li>Rollback Capabilities: If an update fails, you can roll back the entire stack to its previous working state, ensuring your infrastructure remains in a known good configuration.
  <li>Environment Consistency: You can use the same stack definition to create identical environments for development, testing, and production, just with different parameter values.
  <li>Resource Organization: Stacks help organize complex infrastructure into manageable chunks. Rather than having hundreds of individual resources scattered around, you group related ones together logically.
  <li>Permission and Access Control: You can apply security policies and access controls at the stack level, making it easier to manage who can modify which parts of your infrastructure.
</ul>
This stack-based approach transforms infrastructure management from dealing with individual components to orchestrating complete, cohesive systems.
