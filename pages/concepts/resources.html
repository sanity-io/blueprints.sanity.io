<h1>Resources</h1> 

<p>Blueprint resources are the fundamental building blocks that represent infrastructure components you want to create, configure, and manage. These can include Studio, Dataset, Webhook, Functions, and many other infrastructure primitives.</p>

<p>Resources are defined declaratively with either TypeScript or plain JSON:</p>

<bp-code>
  <bp-code-json slot=json>
    {
      "resources": [{ 
        "name": "log-event", 
        "type": "sanity.function.document" 
      ]}
    }
  </bp-code-json>
  <bp-code-ts slot=ts> 
    import {defineBlueprint, defineDocumentFunction} from '@sanity/blueprints'

    export default defineBlueprint({
      resources: [
        defineDocumentFunction({name: 'log-event'}),
      ],
    })
  </bp-code-ts>
</bp-code>


<p>Resources move infrastructure management from a manual, error-prone process into a systematic, reliable engineering practice.</p>

  <li>Consistency and Repeatability: Resources ensure that infrastructure is deployed identically across different environments (development, staging, production). The same resource definition will create the same infrastructure every time.
  <li>Version Control: Since resources are defined in code, you can track changes, review modifications, and roll back to previous versions just like application code.
  <li>Automation: Resources enable fully automated infrastructure provisioning and updates, eliminating manual configuration steps that are prone to human error.
  <li>Documentation: The resource definitions serve as living documentation of your infrastructure, making it clear what components exist and how they're configured.
  <li>Dependency Management: IaC tools understand relationships between resources and can provision them in the correct order, handling dependencies automatically.
  <li>Scalability: Resources can be parameterized and templated, making it easy to scale infra up or down or deploy similar environments with different configurations.
  <li>Cost Management: By defining resources explicitly, you have better visibility into what infrastructure you're running and can more easily optimize costs.
