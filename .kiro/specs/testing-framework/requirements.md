# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a comprehensive testing framework to the blueprints.sanity.io documentation site. The testing framework will ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and validate that all components, routing, and content rendering work correctly. The tests will cover unit testing for individual components, integration testing for the routing system, and end-to-end testing for the complete user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for all custom elements, so that I can ensure each component renders correctly and handles edge cases properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom element is modified THEN the system SHALL run unit tests to verify the component still renders correctly
2. WHEN invalid props are passed to a component THEN the system SHALL validate the component handles errors gracefully
3. WHEN each custom element is tested THEN the system SHALL verify the HTML output matches expected structure
4. IF a component has conditional rendering logic THEN the system SHALL test all code paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for the routing system, so that I can ensure all pages load correctly and return appropriate status codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid route is requested THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with correct HTML content
2. WHEN an invalid route is requested THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code with appropriate error page
3. WHEN a JSON schema file is requested THEN the system SHALL return valid JSON with correct content-type headers
4. WHEN the cache system is tested THEN the system SHALL verify files are cached correctly between requests
5. IF a file is missing THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and return appropriate response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests for the HTML rendering and syntax highlighting, so that I can ensure content is properly formatted and displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTML content is rendered THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting correctly to code blocks
2. WHEN JSON schema content is processed THEN the system SHALL highlight the JSON syntax properly
3. WHEN the layout wrapper is applied THEN the system SHALL include all required HTML document structure
4. WHEN CSS is injected THEN the system SHALL include the stylesheet in the document head
5. IF prism.js highlighting fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to plain text display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end tests for critical user journeys, so that I can ensure the complete user experience works as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display the main navigation and content correctly
2. WHEN a user navigates to different documentation sections THEN the system SHALL load the correct content
3. WHEN a user views code examples THEN the system SHALL display properly highlighted syntax
4. WHEN a user accesses JSON schema files directly THEN the system SHALL serve valid JSON responses
5. IF JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL still display content correctly (progressive enhancement)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution in CI/CD, so that I can catch issues before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL automatically run all tests
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and report specific failures
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow the deployment to proceed
4. WHEN test coverage is below threshold THEN the system SHALL report coverage metrics and fail if below minimum
5. IF tests take too long to run THEN the system SHALL optimize test execution time while maintaining coverage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests for the application, so that I can ensure the site loads quickly and handles concurrent requests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage is loaded THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms for cached requests
2. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them without degradation
3. WHEN large documentation pages are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them within acceptable time limits
4. WHEN the cache is cold THEN the system SHALL still respond within reasonable time bounds
5. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL report performance issues
